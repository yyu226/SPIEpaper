%  article.tex (Version 3.3, released 19 January 2008)
%  Article to demonstrate format for SPIE Proceedings
%  Special instructions are included in this file after the
%  symbol %>>>>
%  Numerous commands are commented out, but included to show how
%  to effect various options, e.g., to print page numbers, etc.
%  This LaTeX source file is composed for LaTeX2e.

%  The following commands have been added in the SPIE class 
%  file (spie.cls) and will not be understood in other classes:
%  \supit{}, \authorinfo{}, \skiplinehalf, \keywords{}
%  The bibliography style file is called spiebib.bst, 
%  which replaces the standard style unstr.bst.  

\documentclass[]{spie}  %>>> use for US letter paper
%%\documentclass[a4paper]{spie}  %>>> use this instead for A4 paper
%%\documentclass[nocompress]{spie}  %>>> to avoid compression of citations
%% \addtolength{\voffset}{9mm}   %>>> moves text field down
%% \renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.65}   %>>> 1.65 for double spacing, 1.25 for 1.5 spacing 
%  The following command loads a graphics package to include images 
%  in the document. It may be necessary to specify a DVI driver option,
%  e.g., [dvips], but that may be inappropriate for some LaTeX 
%  installations. 
\usepackage[]{graphicx}
\usepackage{url}
\usepackage[table, xcdraw]{xcolor}
\usepackage{subcaption}

\title{3D scanning by means of dual-projector structured light illumination} 

%>>>> The author is responsible for formatting the 
%  author list and their institutions.  Use  \skiplinehalf 
%  to separate author list from addresses and between each address.
%  The correspondence between each author and his/her address
%  can be indicated with a superscript in italics, 
%  which is easily obtained with \supit{}.

\author{Daniel L. Lau\supit{a} and Ying Yu\supit{b}
\skiplinehalf
\supit{a}University of Kentucky, Address, Lexington, US; \\
\supit{b}University of Kentucky, Address, Lexington, US
}

%>>>> Further information about the authors, other than their 
%  institution and addresses, should be included as a footnote, 
%  which is facilitated by the \authorinfo{} command.

\authorinfo{Further author information: (Send correspondence to A.A.A.)\\A.A.A.: E-mail: aaa@tbk2.edu, Telephone: 1 505 123 1234\\  B.B.A.: E-mail: bba@cmp.com, Telephone: +33 (0)1 98 76 54 32}

\begin{abstract}
This document shows the desired format and appearance of a manuscript prepared for the Proceedings of the SPIE.  It contains general formatting instructions and hints about how to use LaTeX.  The LaTeX source file that produced this document, {\tt article.tex} (Version 3.3), provides a template, used in conjunction with {\tt spie.cls} (Version 3.3).

Structured light illumination 

\section{HDMI}
HDMI is the abbreviation of High-Definition Multimedia Interface, it is one of the most popular diaplay interfaces. The newest release, HDMI Version 2.1 supports up to $10K$ video at $120 Hz$.

%   \label{Fig:1}% Figure captions are used to describe the figure and help the reader understand it's significance.  The caption should be centered underneath the figure and set in 9-point font.  It is preferable for figures and tables to be placed at the top or bottom of the page. LaTeX tends to adhere to this standard.}

\section{System implementation based on FPGA}
The system diagram is shown in Figure %\ref{}
The system generates structured light patterns at the resolution of $800x600$, the refresh rate of $120 Hz$. According to the document provided by VESA \cite{vesa07}, the HDMI timing should be set as table \ref{Tab:1}.

We utilize an $I^2C$ programmable oscillator Si514 to generate the unusual 73.25MHz pixel clock.
